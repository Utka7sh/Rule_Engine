# Rule Engine

## Description

The Rule Engine project is designed to evaluate user eligibility based on dynamic rules using an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). It allows for the creation, modification, and combination of rules based on various attributes such as age, department, income, and experience. The primary goal of this project is to provide a flexible and efficient way to manage complex eligibility criteria.

## Features

- **Dynamic Rule Creation**: Create and modify rules on the fly, enabling real-time adjustments to eligibility criteria.
- **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)**: Utilize AST for evaluating conditions, making the evaluation process more efficient and easier to understand.
- **User Eligibility Evaluation**: Determine eligibility based on defined rules, allowing users to see if they meet specific criteria.
